This is a tool for dumping 3DS RomFS from the *filesystem* to SD. This requires running under the target title for RomFS dumping. This only transfers the files in the root, directories are not handled. The contentindex is hard-coded, you can change it manually in main() if you want. If you want to dump the entire files, you may want to remove the filesize limit code in dump_file().
